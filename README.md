# Noiseater
Simple python program to solve problem with noisy when idle speakers (Windows 10-11)

The problem that Noise Eater fixes - is that the speakers connected to the PC make terrible noises when idle, but when any sound is turned on (a song, a movie, any audio file), the noises completely disappear. But as soon as you turn off the audio file, the noises return again.

Noise Eater works on a very simple principle, it endlessly repeats an empty .mp3 file (without sound), which creates a constant audio signal and the speakers stop making noise when idle.
